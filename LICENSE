================================================================================
RESTRICTION: PURE LOGIC CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (Solver-Based Control Architecture)
================================================================================

COMMERCIAL USE OF THE FOLLOWING IS PROHIBITED without explicit written license:

"Pure Logic Control Technology" means the SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL COMBINATION of
the following innovations:

1. DECLARATIVE STATE GOVERNANCE
   The method of controlling system outputs by defining "Valid States" via
   bitvector constraints within a satisfiability solver, rather than by
   executing imperative instruction loops (e.g., scan cycles).

2. GEOMETRIC TEMPORAL CONTROL
   The use of native temporal indexing (e.g., x[t] vs x[t-n]) within a logic
   solver to strictly define valid physical transitions and history-dependent
   behavior without the use of memory registers, timers, or accumulators.

3. LOGICAL INVARIANT ENFORCEMENT ("The Unbreakable Guard")
   The architecture of embedding high-priority safety constraints into the
   control logic such that unsafe physical states are rendered mathematically
   unsatisfiable (UNSAT) by the solver, preventing conflicting control signals.

4. SATISFIABILITY-BASED SIGNAL FILTERING
   The method of filtering sensor input by defining logical plausibility
   constraints (e.g., "Physics forbids change > X") and using the solver to
   reject data that violates these constraints.

5. DISCRETE RESOLUTION OF CONTINUOUS DYNAMICS
   The method of mapping continuous error ranges to discrete logical regimes
   (e.g., "Panic", "Hold", "Recover") via logical implication rules, enabling
   complex non-linear control response without floating-point arithmetic.

================================================================================
EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THIS LICENSE (Prior Art / Third-Party IP)
================================================================================

The following are NOT protected and remain open:

✗ Standard Imperative Programming (C++, Python loops)
✗ Standard Programmable Logic Controllers (Scan-based Ladder Logic)
✗ Standard FPGA/Hardware Description Languages (Verilog/VHDL)
✗ Tau Language itself and all IDNI intellectual property
✗ Generic constraint solving algorithms (e.g., Z3, CVC5 mechanics)
✗ Standard PID or Fuzzy Logic mathematical theories

================================================================================
WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROTECTED
================================================================================

✓ The architecture of replacing "Execution Loops" with "Logic Solvers" for control
✓ The specific method of using "UNSAT" as a safety mechanism in control loops
✓ The "Deadbeat" and "Stiction" logic patterns implemented via temporal logic
✓ The integration of a SAT/SMT solver directly into a real-time feedback loop
✓ The specific Tau specifications developed for physical state governance

================================================================================
PATENT NOTICE - UPDATED CLAIMS
================================================================================

The licensor reserves patent rights to the SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL INNOVATION of:
✓ Governing physical actuators via real-time satisfiability solving
✓ Replacing imperative safety checks with declarative logical invariants
✓ The method of geometric temporal indexing for physical state estimation

This restriction applies ONLY to the specific "Pure Logic Control Technology"
as defined above. All other uses remain unrestricted under MIT terms.

================================================================================
EXCEPTION: TAU NET ECOSYSTEM
================================================================================

The above restriction does NOT apply to deployments on Tau Net blockchain.

YOU MAY use this technology commercially on Tau Net IF:

1. Application executes on Tau Net blockchain infrastructure
2. Core control logic uses Tau Language for verification
3. Attribution is maintained: "Powered by l0g1x logic control tech"
4. Source code modifications remain open source

================================================================================
NON-RESTRICTED USES
================================================================================

The following uses are NOT restricted and remain under standard MIT license:

✓ Educational and research purposes
✓ Personal non-commercial projects
✓ Other demos and applications in this repository (non-control related)
✓ Software development tools and utilities
✓ Academic publications and studies
✓ Open source contributions to this project
✓ Use of Standard PID or Fuzzy Logic (prior art)
✓ Use of Tau Language for other purposes (subject to IDNI license)
✓ Generic constraint solving applications

Use for learning Tau Language, constraint programming, formal verification,
or any other non-commercial application is fully permitted.

================================================================================
PATENT NOTICE
================================================================================

The licensor reserves all patent rights to the SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL COMBINATION
of logic-based control innovations described above.

The licensor does NOT claim patent rights to:
✗ Standard PID control theory (prior art)
✗ Tau Language or IDNI technologies (third-party IP)
✗ Generic constraint solving (prior art)
✗ Classical control theory (prior art)
✗ Formal verification methods in general (prior art)

These specific architectural innovations may be subject to patent protection.
The licensor reserves the right to file patent applications for these innovations.

Commercial use of these SPECIFIC innovations outside authorized channels may
constitute patent infringement if patents are granted.

================================================================================
ENFORCEMENT
================================================================================

Unauthorized commercial use of the specifically defined "Pure Logic Control
Technology" constitutes:
1. Breach of this license agreement
2. Potential patent infringement (for the specific protected innovations)
3. Copyright violation

The licensor reserves all legal remedies including injunctive relief and damages.

GOOD FAITH PROVISION:
Inadvertent violations will be given 30-day cure period before legal action.

CLARIFICATION ON SCOPE:
Use of individual techniques (Standard PID, Tau Language, constraint solving)
is NOT a violation. Only unauthorized commercial use of the SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL
COMBINATION defined above constitutes a violation.
