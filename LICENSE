================================================================================
RESTRICTION: PURE LOGIC CONTROL TECHNOLOGY
================================================================================

COMMERCIAL USE OF THE FOLLOWING IS PROHIBITED without explicit written license:

"Pure Logic Control Technology" means the SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL COMBINATION of
the following innovations:

1. DISCRETE REGIME CONTROL ARCHITECTURE
   Replacing continuous calculus-based control terms (Proportional/Derivative)
   with discrete nested logical states (e.g., Panic, Brake, Nudge, Cruise)
   defined by bitvector thresholds within a satisfiability solver.

2. TEMPORAL VELOCITY DETECTION
   Replacing mathematical derivatives (dx/dt) with native temporal lookups
   (x[t] - x[t-1]) within a logic solver to determine system momentum and
   trigger pre-emptive braking states without floating-point arithmetic.

3. LOGIC-BASED INTEGRAL REPLACEMENT ("ANTI-WINDUP LOGIC")
   Replacing the mathematical Integral term with a "Stiction Detection" logic
   trap (Logic: If Error > 0 AND Position == Previous_Position THEN Nudge) to
   eliminate integral windup and overshoot without historical accumulation.

4. THE "TRUST FILTER" SIGNAL PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE
   The specific method of using logical satisfiability to reject sensor noise
   based on physical impossibility (e.g., "Change > X in 1 step is False")
   rather than frequency filtering or averaging.

5. FORMALLY VERIFIED SAFETY GUARDS
   The architecture of embedding safety constraints (e.g., MaxTemp) directly
   into the control loop such that unsafe states are mathematically unsatisfiable
   (UNSAT) within the solver.

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM THIS LICENSE (Prior Art / Third-Party IP):

✗ Standard PID Controllers (Calculus-based Proportional-Integral-Derivative)
✗ Fuzzy Logic Controllers (standard prior art)
✗ Programmable Logic Controllers (standard Ladder Logic)
✗ Tau Language itself and all IDNI intellectual property (separate license)
✗ Generic constraint solving techniques (prior art)
✗ Kalman Filters or standard signal processing
✗ SAT/SMT solving in general (prior art)

WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROTECTED:

✓ The specific architectural combination of the control innovations listed above
✓ The "Deadbeat" logic controller design using temporal braking
✓ The "Nudge" logic design replacing the Integral term
✓ The interactive runner mode discoveries for real-time control
✓ The specific Tau Language formulas and specifications developed for control
✓ The specific integration of temporal logic solvers into feedback loops

PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL USES (without license):

- Integration into HVAC, automotive, or aerospace control systems
- Providing "Logic-Based Control" as a commercial software service
- White-label control solutions using the protected architectural innovations
- Any revenue-generating deployment of the specific technological combination

This restriction applies ONLY to the specific "Pure Logic Control Technology"
as defined above. All other uses remain unrestricted under MIT terms.
